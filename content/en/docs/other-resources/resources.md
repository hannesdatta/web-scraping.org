Below we offer a curation of inspiring methodological papers about collecting web data for academic research:

- [Landers et al. (2016, Psychological Methods)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-25479-001) introduce the notion of a "data source theory" as a critical element for theory-driven web data extractions
- [Xu, Zhang, and Zhou (2020, Journal of Management)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0149206319862027) offer a thoughtful discussion of some of the challenges involved in the collection of "organic" for academic research
- [Edelman (2012, Journal of Economic Perspectives)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.26.2.189) is one of the first articles to identify the potential of extracting web data at scale for academic research
